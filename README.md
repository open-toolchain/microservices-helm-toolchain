# Develop and test microservices with Kubernetes and Helm

### Continuously deliver a microservices app for Kubernetes using a Helm umbrella chart
Get started with this sample, which is an online store that consists of three microservices: a Catalog API, an Orders API, and a UI that calls both of the APIs. The sample includes a DevOps toolchain that is preconfigured for continuous delivery, hosted Git source control, functional testing, issue tracking, online editing, and messaging.

This DevOps process uses a combination of continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines, to orchestrate microservices individually developed into coordinated releases that get promoted through distinct environments. A coordinated release is defined as a Helm umbrella chart, aggregating good versions of individual component Helm charts managed by the CI/CD process.
